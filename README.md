Research has shown that nonverbal communication, including body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, can account for up to 93% of the communication that takes place between individuals. Interrogators use certain physical indicators like facial movements, hand gestures, sweat etc. to determine whether the suspect is lying or holding information. 
With BodySpeak AI, we aim at analyzing all non-verbal communication cues including eye movements, facial muscle movements etc. by using the data from the interrogation cameras using a Deep Learning based model,we will present a detailed report to aid the interrogator. With this, we aim at monitoring the illegal assault of the suspect as well, along with reducing human errored observations during interrogations.
